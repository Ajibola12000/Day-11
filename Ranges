# Creating ranges
numbers = range(5)          # 0 to 4
evens = range(0, 10, 2)     # 0, 2, 4, 6, 8

# Converting to list to see values
print(list(numbers))  # Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

# Accessing elements
print(evens[2])      # Output: 4

# When to use:
# - For loops (most memory efficient)
# - When you need a sequence of numbers without storing them all in memory

for i in range(3):
    print(f"Processing item {i}")

# Checking membership (very efficient)
if 5 in range(10):
    print("5 is in the range")
